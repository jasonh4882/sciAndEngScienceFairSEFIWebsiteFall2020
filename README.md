# Science and Engineering State Science Fair SEFI Scoring Website #

## Description

This project was created as a potential candidate to become the new backend scoring website for the annual SEFI State Science Fair. This submission acted as one possibility out of ten that were pitched to the SEFI comittee. 

The SEFI representative that worked as a client for this project was Andy Harris. A comprehensive video of what was requested:

As a part of the candidate process, four progress presentations were made over the course of twelve weeks. These progress reports highlight all of the functionality of the website.

## Software

The website prototype was hosted on the IUPUI corasir server and was accessed through [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) and [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/) terminal. All webpages were edited in text editors, such as Notepad.exe

## Roadmap

At the end of the Fall 2020 Semester, all ten teams submitted their final prototype for the SEFI Science Fair website. No further contact was made to the group after the end of the semester, so nothing can be said about what decision the comittee made toward which group's efforts were continued. No further work will be done as a result.

## Authors & Acknowledgments

All work was done in response to a request from Professor Harris Andy Harris
